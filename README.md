# Home Task 2 and 3 Description:
Create the class for exception handling base on the Capstone project.

Basic I/O Task 2: 
Questions Answer:

What class and method would you use to read a few pieces of data that are at known positions near the end of a large file?
Files.newByteChannel returns an instance of SeekableByteChannel which allows you to read from (or write to) any position in the file.

When invoking format, what is the best way to indicate a new line?
Use the %n conversion â€” the \n escape is not platform independent!

How would you determine the MIME type of a file?
The Files.probeContentType method uses the platform's underlying file type detector to evaluate and return the MIME type.

What method(s) would you use to determine whether a file is a symbolic link?
You would use the Files.isSymbolicLink method.
